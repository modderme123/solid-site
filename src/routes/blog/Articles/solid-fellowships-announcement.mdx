The SolidJS Core and Ecosystem Teams are excited to announce the launch of a new program to support SolidJS development. 2022 has been an exceptional year for the project's growth. As adoption continues to increase, Core's direct focus is to ensure projects of all sizes and enterprise teams can depend on Solid in production.

With Solid now a year into its v1.0 release and with the coming release of SolidStart, the Core Team is busier than ever laying the foundations for further radical growth. Core Team will leverage funds entrusted to us by our broader community via [OpenCollective](https://opencollective.com/solid) and deploy it to efforts that support better and faster Solid and SolidStart releases.

For this reason we are happy to announce Solid Fellowships, an initiative that non-core community members will be given fixed-term opportunities to work on Core supervised projects. Projects will range from research, bug triage & fixing, writing documentation and general community support tasks.

# Introducing the Inaugural Cohort

We are also pleased to announce that the first Fellowship cohort will be a 5 month engagement with 3 Fellows. Each fellow will receive compensation of US$1000/month. Core has selected the first two Fellows and will open the third to public applications.

Introducing our first two Solid Fellows:

## Alexis H. Munsayac ([lxsmnsyc](https://www.github.com/lxsmnsyc))

Alexis is a software engineer based in the Philippines who has been a long-time member of the Solid community. His work has helped improve the future of reactivity and web development in general. His contributions have included supporting Solid Refresh and DOM Expressions, as well as building libraries to help expand the SolidJS ecosystem. During the tenure of his fellowship, Alexis will support SolidStart release efforts. Having developed Rigidity, Waystone and similar meta-framework tooling he is an ideal candidate to support Core in bringing Start to production readiness.

## Damian Tarnawski ([thetarnav](https://www.github.com/thetarnav))

Damian is a web developer who was born and lives in Poland. Technology, reactivity and architecting original ideas as open-source projects have always been amongst his great passions. He has been an active contributor to Solid Primitives and is currently focused on Solid Developer Tools, a suite of utilities designed for making working with Solid easier. During the tenure of his fellowship, Damian will focus on Developer Tools and supporting integration with SolidStart to ensure that the DX story between tooling is of the highest quality possible.

# Call for Submissions

Our third Fellowship position will be focused specifically on documentation writing and is open to a public call for applications. With Solid API and SolidStart API documentation rewrites in the works our team would like to supercharge the effort with a dedicated individual.

We're seeking a Fellow member excited about educating users and writing fun, clear and concise documentation. Applicants should have writing experience and at least beginner Solid experience (or advanced React knowledge). Solid is also committed to providing equal opportunities for all. We welcome individuals from all walks of life.

The position will provide US$1000/month and be awarded to an individual selected by Core and Ecosystem members. The final decision will be based on a number of factors including but not limited to: experience, availability, technical writing abilities etc.

# Budget and Awarding Fellowships

The Fellowship program will launch with a meager budget with the intention of growing it through further sponsorship fundraising. If your organization is interested in using Solid, now's your moment to support Solid’s adoption story and help it produce a highly durable and performant library. Kindly donate directly to our OpenCollective or email [community@solidjs.com](mailto:community@solidjs.com) for more information.

Solid Fellows will be granted to members that are actively involved in furthering Solid’s goals. The Core team will continue selecting future cohort members based on general interest and availability of talented contributors willing to focus on Solid efforts. If you have an idea or interest in being involved, reach out to our team members to start the conversation!

Thank you to everyone, especially our OpenColletive sponsors for making this possible. Solid remains committed to being progressive and pushing the boundaries. We hope that Fellowships become a successful program that fosters strong community bonds, friendships and rock-solid careers.

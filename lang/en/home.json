If you've developed with React Functional Components and Hooks before, Solid will feel very natural because it follows the same philosophy as React, with unidirectional data flow, read/write segregation, and immutable interfaces.",
      "It may feel even more natural because Solid's update model is simpler and has no Hook rules. Components execute just once, when they are first rendered, and Hooks and bindings only execute when their dependencies update. This completely different implementation forgoes a Virtual DOM."
